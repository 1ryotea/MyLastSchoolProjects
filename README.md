This is my highschool last project, i made an e-commerce website using HTML,CSS,PHP and Little bit of javascript.
Not the best but i do my best. 
I'm using XAMPP for Apache webserver and PHPMYADMIN for DATABASE. 
For me, The website design are very sucks, because this is not the first design that i was made, there's a lot of revision because of my teacher request.
And  don't know if there is still a bug.
